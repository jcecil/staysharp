// Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write amethod to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.Object.*;

class Rotate{

public static void main (String [] args) {
}

static void rotate(int[][] image){
	for (int i = 0; i < image.length; i++){
		for (int j = 0; j < image[0].length; j++){
	this one can't easily be done on a whiteboard without bufferedimage class etc, but I understand how to rotate a matrix. detailed explanation here:
