use a hashmap where the key is an int / string / etc instead of implementing your own hashcode / equals methods.
Use Integer, Character, Long, Double classes when adding items to a map or set.

array.length
String.length()
Arraylist.size()

string.charAt(i)
string.replace("","") replaces all instances. This is what you want.
string.replaceAll() expects a regex

set.add(k)
set.contains(k)
map.put(k,v)
map.containsKey(k)


linkedhashmap is faster than hashmap when we need to do things like map.keyset
hashmap.keyset iterates over all items in the capacity
linkedhashmap.keyset iterates over all items that have been added to the list already
Iteration over the collection-views of a LinkedHashMap requires time proportional to the size of the map, regardless of its capacity. Iteration over a HashMap is likely to be more expensive, requiring time proportional to its capacity.
